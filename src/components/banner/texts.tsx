export const text3: string = "I'm a fullstack developer that focuses on building web apps. My strength is my passion and stubbornness and frontend development. I have also worked with backed to be able to understand and build complete web apps. I feel most comfortable with JavaScript and constantly want to improve my skills. I have always had an interest in tech. I grew up playing computer games and were fascinated by how things worked. My curiosity on how the web worked spiked my interest and i wanted to build things myself. Programming still amazes me, in't incredible what we can build and achieve with just code. I am a curious person and always strive to improve and learn as much as possible.During my spare time i enjoy walking with my dog in the woods. If i'm not found outside with my dog, then you would most likely find me in the kitchen trying out new recipes. I also like to build mechanical keyboards.";
